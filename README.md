A tic tac toe game!
Live: https://sleepyadi.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

## Project Summary

Simple tic tac toe game made mostly using module pattern(with IIFE) and factory functions (after learning about them in the odin project) to have as less global code as possible.


## Features
- A working tic tac toe game!
- was made mobile first so should work on most phones without breaking (hopefully!)
- has option to choose vs player or vs easy bot (the easy bot just chooses a random spot from available spot :p)

## TODO:
- add a way to highlight current player
- possibly make it look a tiny bit better (when i learn some animations.)
